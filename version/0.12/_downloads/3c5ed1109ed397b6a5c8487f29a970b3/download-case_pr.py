----------------------------------------------------
This example shows how to download a Strocchi 2020 or Rodero 2021 case from the Zenodo
database.
"""

###############################################################################
# .. note::
#    You can also manually download the CASE or VTK files from the Strocchi 2020
#    and Rodero 2021 databases. For more information, see:
#
#    - `A Publicly Available Virtual Cohort of Four-chamber Heart Meshes for
#      Cardiac Electro-mechanics Simulations <https://zenodo.org/records/3890034>`_
#    - `Virtual cohort of adult healthy four-chamber heart meshes from CT images <https://zenodo.org/records/4590294>`_
#
#    Alternatively you can make use of the download
#    module instead. See the example below.


# Perform the required imports
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Import the required modules and set relevant paths, including that of the working
# directory and generated model.

from pathlib import Path

from ansys.health.heart.utils.download import download_case_from_zenodo, unpack_case

# Download the tar file of Rodero2021 from the Zenodo database.
download_dir = Path.home() / "pyansys-heart" / "downloads"
tar_file = download_case_from_zenodo("Rodero2021", 1, download_dir, overwrite=True)

# Unpack the tar file and get the path to the input .vtk/.case file.
path = unpack_case(tar_file)

print(path)
