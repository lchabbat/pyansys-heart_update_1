# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Import the required modules and set relevant paths, including that of the working
# directory and generated model.

import glob
from pathlib import Path

from ansys.heart.core.utils.download import download_case_from_zenodo, unpack_case

# Download the tar file of Rodero2021 from the Zenodo database.
download_dir = Path.home() / "pyansys-heart" / "downloads"
tar_file = download_case_from_zenodo("Rodero2021", 1, download_dir)

# Unpack the tar file and get the path to the input .vtk/.case file.
path = unpack_case(tar_file)

print(path)

# list all files
glob.glob("downloads" + "/**/*.*", recursive=True)

# .. note::
#    You can also manually download the .case or .vtk files from the Strocchi2020
#    and Rodero2021 databases first. See:
#
#    - https://zenodo.org/records/3890034
#    - https://zenodo.org/records/4590294
#
#    Alternatively you can make use of the download
#    module instead. See the example below.
